# boa, the fast build tool for conda packages

```
Note: boa is still a work-in-progress.
```

**boa** is a package builder for conda packages. </br>
It largely re-uses the `conda-build` infrastructure, except for some parts. For example the 'solving stage' which, in Boa, is done using `mamba`, the fast `conda`-alternative. Learn more about `mamba` [here](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#readme).

We are also working towards a new "meta.yaml" format in the `boa/cli/render.py` source file. Read more about it [here](https://boa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipe_spec.html). </br>
The new "meta.yaml" format is still a work-in-progress and might not work as expected.

The discussions about this new `meta.yaml` format take place [here](https://hackmd.io/axI1tQdwQB2pTJKt5XdY5w). We encourage you to participate.

The short-term goal for boa is to parse the new version spec, and produce a `conda_build.MetaData` class in Python that describes how to assemble the final package.

We have these tools included with boa:

```
conda mambabuild my_recipe_folder
```
This is equivalent to running `conda build my_recipe_folder` but using mamba as a solver.

```
boa render my_recipe_folder
```
"Render" a recipe. (Note that you must use the non-final v2 syntax. Check the recipes folder for examples.)

```
boa build my_recipe_folder
```
Runs a "build" of the v2 recipe.

### Dev Installation

Install the boa dependencies:
```
mamba install "conda-build>=3.20" colorama pip ruamel ruamel.yaml rich mamba jsonschema -c conda-forge
```

Now install boa:
```
pip install -e .
```
